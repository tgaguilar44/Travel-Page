            Visit the Eiffel Tower! <br>    <!--THIS IS THE DESTINATION DESCRIPTION-->
            <div class="description">
                The Eiffel Tower (la Tour Eiffel) ranks high on the list of places to visit in France and is the
                most-visited
                tourist attraction in the world.<br> It's hard to believe that the structure was dismissed as a
                monstrosity when it
                was first unveiled.<br> The iconic tower was designed by Alexandre-Gustave Eiffel for the Paris
                Exhibition of 1889,
                which marked the centenary of the French Revolution.

            Visit the Musée du Louvre! <br>
            <div class="description">
                A sumptuous palace that was once the home of France's kings, the Louvre is the most important of Paris'
                top museums.<br>
                Visitors enter the museum in the courtyard of the palace at the Pyramid du Louvre, the glass pyramid
                designed by Ieoh
                Ming Pei in 1917.<br> The Musée du Louvre displays thousands of artworks, many of which are considered
                masterpieces, from
                antiquities to European paintings of the 15th to 19th centuries.

            <div class="description">
                Notre-Dame stands in the heart of Paris on the Île-de-la-Cité next to the Latin Quarter.<br>
                An island in the Seine River, the Île-de-la-Cité is the historical and geographical center of Paris.<br>
                On this small plot of land, the Romans built the Gallo-Roman city of Lutetia, and from the 6th century
                to the 14th century, the Kings of France resided here.

    <div class="mealheader">Meals to Feast on in Paris</div><!--meal header-->
        <div class="meal">
            <div class="meal1">Croissants: Cheap, yet unforgettable <br><!--meals in paris-->
                <div class="mealdesc">  <!--meal description-->
                    Start your day like a true Parisian and get yourself an all-butter croissant for breakfast! <br>
                    <br>
                    Croissants may look simple, but these perfectly flaky pastries require time (we’re talking several days!) and a whole set of skills to perfect.
                    Whether you have them with your coffee, orange juice, or on their own, croissants are guaranteed to brighten up your morning! <br>
                    <br>
                    And no need to worry about missing out on precious sightseeing time to sit down for breakfast. While lunch and dinner are more sacred sit-down affairs, breakfast on the go is completely acceptable here in France, so you can enjoy your croissant wherever.

            <div class="meal2"> Escargots: A national symbol <br><!--meals in paris-->
                <div class="mealdesc">  <!--meal description-->
                    You just can’t leave Paris without trying them! <br>
                    <br>
                    Though we enjoy snails cooked in a variety of ways in Paris, the Burgundy recipe remains the most popular. The escargots (usually a dozen of them) are presented in their shells and stuffed with a mouthwatering combination of garlic, herbs and butter. <br>
                    <br>
                    However, escargots a re now so popular that countless Paris restaurants have put their own creative spin on the dish. You’ll now find snails served with Roquefort, truffle, and even curry-based sauces, and so much more. <br>
                    <br>
                    Want to know the best part? Not only are escargots delicious, but they’re also rich in iron and magnesium!

            <div class="meal3"> Macarons <br><!--meals in paris-->
                <div class="mealdesc">  <!--meal description-->
                    Not to be confused with macaroons (shredded coconut delicacies), macarons are possibly the best thing that ever happened to French sweets. Their delicate and airy shells are made of almond flour, and filled with a rich, luscious interior. <br>
                    <br>
                    Nobody is quite sure where, exactly, these iconic treats come from. Some stories credit Catherine de Medici with the idea; others, a late 18th-century French Carmelite convent. But no matter which version of the story you believe, macarons might just be the most famous food in Paris today. <br>
                    <br>
                    Popular flavors include pistachio, chocolate, vanilla or raspberry, but don’t be scared to try some of the more unusual options: salted butter caramel, green tea, or rose petals, just to name a few.

    <div class="hotelheader"> Hotels to sleep in Paris</div>
        <div class="hotel">
            <div class="hotel1"> Cheval Blanc Paris, 1st arrondissement <br><!--hotels in paris-->
                <div class="hoteldesc">  <!--hotel description-->
                    It seems fitting that Cheval Blanc would open its first urban hotel where so many of its clients reside — and where better than within the landmark La Samaritaine? <br>
                    <br>
                    With nearly 600 artisans involved in the restoration and works by global artists exhibited throughout the space, Cheval Blanc Paris feels like entering a living museum, one where you can very comfortably spend the night. <br>
                    Almost every one of the 72 sleek rooms – most of which are spacious suites – overlooks the Seine; the seventh-floor Art Deco brasserie meets cocktail bar, Le Tout-Paris, is the place to be seen before escaping to the subterranean spa helmed by Dior.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="hotel2"> Le Roch Hotel and Spa, 1st arrondissement <br><!--hotels in paris-->
                <div class="hoteldesc">  <!--hotel description-->
                    When Le Roch ('rock' not 'rosh') opened, the local parish priest and the headmistress from the school around the corner dropped by to say hello. <br>
                    <br>
                    They must be pretty chic pastoral types; certainly they're tending their flocks in a very smart neighbourhood adjacent to the Place Vendôme.
                    But somehow the gesture seems just right. Le Roch, despite its velvety textured swishiness and its fancy address, has a winningly unaffected aura.
                    You sense it the moment you step inside off the rue Saint-Roch – a quiet byway hidden among the grand thoroughfares that dominate this part of the city. There's an easy flow from lobby through to library, bar, dining room and courtyard.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="hotel3"> Monsieur George, 8th arrondissement <br><!--hotels in paris-->
                <div class="hoteldesc">  <!--hotel description-->
                    George Washington never went to Paris. The farthest he ever got from home was a short visit to Barbados. <br>
                    <br>
                    Yet the Parisians held him in sufficiently high esteem to erect two fine statues in his honour and to name a street after him, each of them in a notably posh part of the capital.<br>
                    Now the street dubbed rue Washington in his memory has a hotel in a converted townhouse at number 17 that bears his name too: Monsieur George, a delicious bite-sized macaron of a place. <br>
                    Credit for the hotel’s deliciousness must go to its interior designer, Anouska Hempel, a woman of many talents and exceptional energy.

                Baron Haussmann designed the boulevard's elegant buildings.

                of 18th-century Paris. The Place de la Concorde was the scene of several key historical events,
                including the executions of Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette, among other victims of the guillotine.
                The square was also part of Napoleon's triumphal route.

                Commissioned by Napoleon III in 1860, the Palais Garnier Opera House was designed by Charles Garnier
                in an exuberant Baroque style. Garnier worked tirelessly on the project for over a decade, from 1862
                to 1875. Today, this show-stopping landmark is a symbol of Napoleon's Imperial regime.

                and the First Empire (Napoleonic Wars). Napoleon commissioned the building of this mighty structure

                . The Seine River bridges, Eiffel Tower, Notre-Dame Cathedral, and the Louvre Museum look stunning from the viewpoint of a riverboat.

                Sainte-Chapelle is considered a rare jewel among medieval houses of worship and is certainly one of the most exquisite churches in Paris.
                The ravishing 13th-century chapel is tucked away on the Île-de-la-Cité, just a few blocks away (about a 10-minute walk) from the Notre-Dame Cathedral.

                by King Henri IV, and they were designed in the style of the Boboli Gardens in Florence. In the 19th century, the architect
                Jean-François Chalgrin updated the layout of the Jardin du Luxembourg.
