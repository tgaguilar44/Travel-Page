            Visit the Eiffel Tower! <br>    <!--THIS IS THE DESTINATION DESCRIPTION-->
            <div class="description">
                The Eiffel Tower (la Tour Eiffel) ranks high on the list of places to visit in France and is the
                most-visited
                tourist attraction in the world.<br> It's hard to believe that the structure was dismissed as a
                monstrosity when it
                was first unveiled.<br> The iconic tower was designed by Alexandre-Gustave Eiffel for the Paris
                Exhibition of 1889,
                which marked the centenary of the French Revolution.

            Visit the Musée du Louvre! <br>
            <div class="description">
                A sumptuous palace that was once the home of France's kings, the Louvre is the most important of Paris'
                top museums.
                Visitors enter the museum in the courtyard of the palace at the Pyramid du Louvre, the glass pyramid
                designed by Ieoh
                Ming Pei in 1917. The Musée du Louvre displays thousands of artworks, many of which are considered
                masterpieces, from
                antiquities to European paintings of the 15th to 19th centuries.

                An island in the Seine River, the Île-de-la-Cité is the historical and geographical center of Paris.<br>
                On this small plot of land, the Romans built the Gallo-Roman city of Lutetia, and from the 6th century
                to the 14th century, the Kings of France resided here.

                Baron Haussmann designed the boulevard's elegant buildings.
